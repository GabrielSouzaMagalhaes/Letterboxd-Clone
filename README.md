# Letterboxd-Clone
Letterboxd-Clone is a web application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack. It is a clone of the popular movie and television review website, Letterboxd. The application allows users to search for and review movies and television shows, view ratings and reviews from other users, and keep track of their own watchlist.

# Roadmap

## 2. Develop the Backend API
- Use Express.js to create a RESTful API
- Connect to the MongoDB database to perform CRUD operations
- Endpoints for authentication, movie browsing, reviewing, and user management

## 3. Build the Frontend Interface
- Use React to create a user-friendly interface
- Pages for browsing and searching for movies, leaving reviews, and managing personal profiles

## 4. Implement Authentication and Authorization
